Could really go for a tasty pizza when I get off of work just to cheer me up, and will pay it forward hopefully on the 3rd when I get paid again. \n Thanks for reading.", "request_title": "[Request] Iowan Looking for Some Pizza", "requester_account_age_in_days_at_request": 81.95252314814815, "requester_account_age_in_days_at_retrieval": 308.6346875, "requester_days_since_first_post_on_raop_at_request": 0.0, "requester_days_since_first_post_on_raop_at_retrieval": 226.64049768518518, "requester_number_of_comments_at_request": 103, "requester_number_of_comments_at_retrieval": 755, "requester_number_of_comments_in_raop_at_request": 0, "requester_number_of_comments_in_raop_at_retrieval": 5, "requester_number_of_posts_at_request": 2, "requester_number_of_posts_at_retrieval": 15, "requester_number_of_posts_on_raop_at_request": 0, "requester_number_of_posts_on_raop_at_retrieval": 2, "requester_number_of_subreddits_at_request": 14, "requester_received_pizza": true, "requester_subreddits_at_request": ["AskReddit", "DatingHell", "FearMe", "IAmA", "LetsNotMeet", "Paranormal", "Random_Acts_Of_Amazon", "aww", "buildapcforme", "cringe", "cringepics", "politics", "popping", "todayilearned"], "requester_upvotes_minus_downvotes_at_request": 278, "requester_upvotes_minus_downvotes_at_retrieval": 1659, "requester_upvotes_plus_downvotes_at_request": 350, "requester_upvotes_plus_downvotes_at_retrieval": 1947, "requester_user_flair": "shroom", "requester_username": "Drynian", "unix_timestamp_of_request": 1366735861.0, "unix_timestamp_of_request_utc": 1366732261.0}, {"giver_username_if_known": "N/A", "in_test_set": false, "number_of_downvotes_of_request_at_retrieval": 0, "number_of_upvotes_of_request_at_retrieval": 3, "post_was_edited": 1339642100.0, "request_id": "t3_v0yeh", "request_number_of_comments_at_retrieval": 8, "request_text": "I'll spare you my sob story.
